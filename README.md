# memory-phone-numbers

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/demo-online-blue.svg)](https://memory-phone-numbers.vercel.app/)

Learn and memorize phone numbers with a memory game.

## Why ?

In movies or TV shows, when a character dials a number from an other phone than his own, don't you wonder how he knows the number ?

If you need to make a call witout access to your contacts, can you dial the number from memory ? I know I can't.

This is why I built this app. At least to remember a few critical numbers.

## Features

- Add, edit, and delete contacts.
- Play the game with the contacts.

  - Your data is stored locally in your browser.
